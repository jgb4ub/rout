# Round-Trip-Routing

This application is designed to allow users to discover new routes that they might like to take.

Intended to be used for walking/running/biking along new routes, Roundabout (or R.out), allows users to set their starting position (their location, if desired, otherwise they can search for a place or manually select a place on the map). Then, users may opt to include "waypoints" that they would like to pass by on their trip.

API requests are generated and submitted, then evaluated and efficiently adjusted until the route length is within 5% error of the user's requested route length. The final route as well as elevation information and difficulty estimation are presented.

The app can be viewed at the link below, though the API key is no longer active.
